Repository for Western Snowy Plover Nest Habitat Project

# Overview
This repository contains the data and scripts to analyze differences in nest sites and random sites using habitat characteristics from two seperate time frames in order to understand nest site selection of snowy plovers. 

# About the Project
Results from this project are presented in the manuscript "Nest sites differ from available habitat for Western Snowy Plover in California’s Central Coast but habitat variation from breeding season to post-breeding is negligible" by Alice Voulfson, Stephanie Coates, George Cummins, and Kriss Neuman.

This project analyzes nest site habitat of beach-nesting Western Snowy Plovers compared to available habitat during the breeding season and in the fall, after breeding concludes, in order to understand nest site selection, as well as the applicabilty of assessing nesting habitat in the fall to minimize disturbances to sensitive species. We conduct nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations to examine the overall vegetation community composition of nest sites and random points in the breeding season and post-breeding fall. We use generalized logistic regression models with a binomial (logit) link to further understand how microhabitat characteristics differed between nest sites and random points, and whether conclusions differed when using only post-breeding fall data compared to data collected during the breeding season or across both seasons.

# Getting Started
## Scripts used
Scripts for all analysis are included in the 'R' subfolder.

## Data sets used
Two data sets are used in the analysis. The first includes all location information and habitat data collected at nests and random points ("SNPL_nest_habitat_CLEAN.csv") and the second links nests and their associated random point. Additional data subsets are created from these datasets.
