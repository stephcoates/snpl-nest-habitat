Repository for Western Snowy Plover Nest Habitat Project

# Overview
This repository can be used to analyze differences in nest sites and random sites using different categories of measures among two seperate time frames in order to understand nest site selection of ground-nesting shorebirds. 

# About the Project
This repository contains the R scripts and all datasets used in developing the analyses and results presented in the manuscript "Nest sites differ from available habitat for Western Snowy Plover in California’s Central Coast but habitat variation from breeding season to post-breeding fall is negligible" by Alice Voulfson, Stephanie Coates, Geroge Cummins, and Kriss Neuman.

Our project analyzes nest site habitat of Western Snowy Plovers compared to available habitat during the breeding season and in the fall, after breeding concludes, in order to understand nest site selection, as well as the applicabilty of assessing nesting habitat in the fall to minimize disturbances to sensitive species. We conduct nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations to examine the overall vegetation community composition of nest sites and random points in the breeding season and post-breeding fall. We use generalized logistic regression models with a binomial (logit) link to further understand how microhabitat characteristics differed between nest sites and random points, and whether conclusions differed when using only post-breeding fall data compared to data collected during the breeding season or across both seasons.

# Getting Started
## Scripts used

## Data sets used
Our data is split into four different point types: nest sites surveyed during the breeding season, random points surveyed during the breeding season, the same nest sites surveyed in the fall, and the same random points surveyed in the fall. For both analyses types, we utilized three different groups of covariates: 1) summarized microhabitat features; 2) percent cover of individual cover types; 3) percent cover of dune plant functional groups, with minor differences in variable inclusion between analyses.
